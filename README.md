Now... my attempts. I have tried with Ymu759 first - no success, it does not work, I was not able to initialize the chip properly - apparently there were too many differences and I do not have so much time to reverse engineer ROMs from phones that used this IC.
When I received Ymu762-s, I tried this with Gospodin Riba's code (modified, as I have a different XTAL, also I wanted to use line out and instead of speaker), then I ported this to CubeMX (and added some more features, like live MA-3 register access debug via USB).

Wegi received my second ("hand made in Poland") PCB with MA-3 and all the code I created. That's all.
